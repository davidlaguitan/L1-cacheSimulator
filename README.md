# L1-cacheSimulator
A C program that tracks the number of memory reads, memory writes, cache hits, and cache misses given a hexadecimal address. Cache size, associativity, replacement policy (FIFO or LRU), and block size are input parameters for this program. The code still has memory leaks, and will be updated in the near future.
